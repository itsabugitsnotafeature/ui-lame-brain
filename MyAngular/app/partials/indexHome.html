		<p style="margin: 10; padding: 0;">
			Welcome ! Most, if not all of what you see here was designed as a feature. Although, if you happen to come across an extra-ordinary phenomena, to put simply - a <em>Bug</em> , feel free to consider that as feature or drop in a comment under the <a ui-sref="About">About </a>section. 
			<br> <br>
			For those craving to know more about <abbr title="'Feature! Not a Bug'">FnB</abbr> history, the preface is as follows. I come from a long dark history of working in Quality. By 'Long' meaning 4 years of experience with 2 in core web technologies, and by 'Dark' meaning mostly seen as an under dog by the developer community but motivated by each mistake made. If that didn't bring tear to your eyes, congratulations you have no soul.
			<br> <br>
			The Intent of this application is to encourage and motivate all those who browse this page to write code regardless of the fact if its good or bad. At the end of the day, when you check in all the filthy code but get the feature running my monkey patching or simply duct-taping the broken parts, you'll come to realize the next day the missing components that makes a code readable / reliable and resilient to changes in deployment.
